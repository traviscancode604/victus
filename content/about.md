Hi! I am a DevOps Engineer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator with a background in electrical engineering. I am passionate about delivering high-quality solutions to end users. My experience with CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes has allowed me to frequently build and deploy production-grade code, while ensuring seamless integration and reliability for end-users. I am proficient in Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, Jenkins, ELK Stack, etc.

I enjoy working on personal and professional side projects during my free time. This allows me to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends, while also exploring new and innovative ideas that I can bring to my work. I am also a Professional Engineer (Non-Practising) with extensive experience in building automation systems, project management and process optimization.

My diverse background as a Building Automation System Programmer, Maintenance Manager, and an Award-Winning Certified Energy Manager has provided me with a unique skill set that I apply to all of my work. I bring a holistic approach to problem-solving and am able to identify and address issues from multiple perspectives. Whether it's optimizing processes to improve efficiency, reducing costs through innovative solutions, or finding ways to streamline workflows, I am always looking for opportunities to add value and make a positive impact.
